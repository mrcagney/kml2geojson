kml2geojson is a Python 3.4+ package to convert KML files to GeoJSON files.
Most of its code is a translation into Python of the Node.js package `togeojson <https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson>`_, but kml2geojson also adds the following features.

- Preserve KML object styling, such as color and opacity
- Optionally write one JSON file cataloging all the KML styles used
- Optionally create several GeoJSON files of FeatureCollections, one for each KML folder 


Installation
=============
``pip install kml2geojson``


Usage
======
At the command line type ``k2g --help`` for instructions.
You can also use kml2geojson as a library.


Documentation
==============
In ``docs`` and on RawGit `here <https://rawgit.com/araichev/kml2geojson/master/docs/_build/singlehtml/index.html>`_.


Notes
========
- Development status: Alpha
- This project uses semantic versioning (major.minor.micro), where each breaking feature or API change is considered a major change

Contributing
===================
If you want to help develop this project, here is some background reading.

- The `KML reference <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference?hl=en>`_ 
- Python's `Minimal DOM implementation <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/xml.dom.minidom.html>`_, which this project uses to parse KML files
