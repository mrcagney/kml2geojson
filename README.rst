kml2geojson is a Python 3.6+ package to convert KML files to GeoJSON files.
Most of its code is a translation into Python of the Node.js package `togeojson <https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson>`_, but kml2geojson also adds the following features.

- Preserve KML object styling, such as color and opacity
- Optionally create a style dictionary cataloging all the KML styles used
- Optionally create several GeoJSON FeatureCollections, one for each KML folder present


Installation
=============
Create a Python 3.6+ virtual environment and run ``poetry add kml2geojson``.


Usage
======
Use as a library or from the command line.
For instructions on the latter, type ``k2g --help``.


Documentation
==============
In the ``docs`` directory and published at `mrcagney.github.io/kml2geojson_docs <https://mrcagney.github.io/kml2geojson_docs/>`_.
